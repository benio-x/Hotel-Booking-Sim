This code is a simple computer program for a hotel to create an easy system for bookings, it works like this.

When the program starts, it sets up a hotel with a certain number of rooms that people can book.
It shows which rooms are free (not booked yet) and lets someone pick a room they want.
If the room they choose is free, the program books it for them. If the room is already taken or the room number doesn't exist, it tells them to pick a different one.
After booking a room, it asks if they want to book another room. They can keep booking rooms until they decide to stop or if they pick a room that can't be booked.
In the end, it tells them how many rooms they've booked and says goodbye.
The program is meant to make booking hotel rooms simple by just picking room numbers and following simple yes or no questions:)

*can be run by entering g++ main.cpp into your terminal, click enter, then type ./a.out
